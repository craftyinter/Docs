Intro:

Zero uses ZEROcash Protocol

ZERO is fork of Zcash (Zcash is fork of Bitcoin). It has security of Bitcoin, privacy of Zcash and few other improvements. ZERO includes the best privacy and anonymity technology available today.

Zero was created by zerocurrency in February 2017 as a means to improve Zcash's features. Soon after its creation, the unknown developer lost interest and the project laid dormant until the end of year. A first community takeover took place by Demarsac in November 2017 and Zero was revived for a short period of time. As of April 2018, the community took over again, in another effort to implement more features and to allow more people to get actively involved.

Our main focus as a team and community is to remain as transparent as we can possibly be, and to maintain an interactive relationship with everyone involved. We are fully open about the project, listening to all suggestions from investors, miners and supporters.
